# NN Junior Case

Welcome to the junior programming case for NN.

This exercise consists of two separate parts. You can complete each independently of the other.

## Segments

The segments exercise will require you to implement some functionality in already provided methods. 
Then, the provided unit tests are executed to validate your solution.

## Fish
The fish exercise will require you to implement an algorithm to simulate the reproductive rate of an imaginary 
population of fish. See [its README.md](src/main/java/be/nn/hiring/junior/fish/README.md) for more information.
